Ectopy Hardware Setup

---
Required Hardware

- A computer to run the analysis software

- Arduino Uno or equivalent to capture sensor input

- Pulse Sensor
    The less smart the better; expensive FDA approved units seem to
    filter out some of my ectopic beats; this one worked for me:

Setup

The steps in this section only need to be done once:

1. Install Arduino IDE Software on computer
    Download and install from http://arduino.cc

2. Configure and test the Arduino IDE software
    Connect the Arduino to the computer with the USB cable
    Set the board type in Tools -> Board
    Set the processor type in Tools -> Processor
    Select the appropriate port in Tools -> Port
    Upload a simple "blink" sketch from File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink
        to make sure the connection is good and the board and upload
        process are working

3. Download the ectopy.js software from Github
    Browse to https://github.com/billroy/ectopy
    Click Download
    Unzip the downloaded file; it will produce a folder named "ectopy"

4. Use Arduino IDE to install ectopy/heartbeat-detector.ino on Arduino
    Open ectopy/heartbeat-detector.ino in an editor
    Copy all the text
    Open a new file in the Arduino IDE (File -> New)
    Paste in all the text from ectopy/heartbeat-detector.ino
    File -> Upload

5. Connect sensor to Arduino
    This is best done with the Arduino powered off
    - black wire to Ground (GND)
    - red wire to +5 Volts (+5 or VCC);
        3.3 Volts (+3.3 or VCC) also works on a 3.3 volt Arduino
    - purple sense wire to analog input pin 0 (A0)

6. Test Sensor
    Put the sensor on your finger with the Arduino powered on,
    and the board should flash an LED with your heartbeat

7. Install node.js to run the ectopy.js software
    Download and install procedure at http://nodejs.org

8. In a Terminal window, install the dependencies of ectopy.js
    cd ectopy
    npm install

Running the program

1. In a Terminal window, run ectopy.js
    cd ectopy
    node ectopy.js

    (When you're done you can stop the program with Control-C)

2. Open a browser to see the application
    Open a browser to http://localhost:3000
    You should see the application start up with a blank chart

3. Put the sensor on your finger and adjust until it's producing pulses
    I find it helps to have a pulse-ox on another finger to make sure
    the beats are correct

4. When you have "good contact", press the Clear button to start a
fresh chart; this also marks the beat log so you can re-use the data.

5. After 100 beats or so, you might want to Mark the chart with a
comment for the log, and capture a screenshot.

About the display

The graph is a Poincare phase plot of the R-R interval (what a layman calls
the heartbeat) lagged against itself with a delay of one beat.

A short beat like a PVC will appear as a dot to the left of the main cluster,
while a longer beat like an escape beat will appear as a dot to the right
of the main cluster.

It is possible to observe trigeminy and quadrigeminy patterns by following
the connections between successive beats on the graph.

Beats are color-coded based on the difference between the duration of this
beat and the previous one.

    green:  < 50ms
    orange: > 50 ms and < 100ms
    red:    > 100ms and < 200ms
    purple: > 200ms

Using Ectopy

- put the sensor on and fiddle it until the data stream looks good
- click the "clear" button to start a new chart
- accumulate 100 beats or so
- use "mark" to add a comment to identify the chart
- take a screenshot

---
Other Facilities

The program writes every heartbeat it receives to a file named beats.log in
the ectopy directory, for future analysis.

In the More... menu, the Import and Export functions let you import and export
beat sessions in text format.

---
Hardware Outputs

The software provides a flash on pin 13 at each beat.

The software provides a brief tone at each beat on pin 11 suitable for
playing through a piezo buzzer connected to ground via 330 ohms.

There are timing outputs on pins 4 and 12 that will only be of interest
to developers.
