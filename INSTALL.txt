Ectopy Hardware Setup

---
Required Hardware

- A computer to run the analysis software

- Arduino Uno or equivalent to capture sensor input
    https://www.adafruit.com/products/50

- Pulse Sensor
    The less smart the better; expensive FDA approved units seem to
    filter out some of my ectopic beats; this one worked for me:

Setup

The steps in this section only need to be done once:

1. Install Arduino IDE Software on computer
    Download and install from http://arduino.cc

2. Configure and test the Arduino IDE software
    Set the board type and port in Tools -> Board and -> Port
    Upload a simple "blink" sketch from File -> Examples -> 01.Basics -> Blink
        to make sure the connection is good and the board and upload
        process are working

3. Use Arduino IDE to install heartbeat-detector.ino on Arduino
    Open heartbeat-detector.ino in an editor
    Copy all the text
    Open a new file in the Arduino IDE (File -> New)
    Paste in all the text
    File -> Upload

4. Connect sensor to Arduino
    This is best done with the Arduino powered off
    - black wire to Ground (GND)
    - red wire to +5 Volts (+5)
    - sense wire to analog input pin 0 (A0)

5. Test Sensor
    Put the sensor on your finger with the Arduino powered on,
    and the board should flash an LED with your heartbeat

6. Install node.js to run the ectopy.js software
    Download and install procedure at http://nodejs.org

7. Download the ectopy.js software from Github
    Browse to https://github.com/billroy/ectopy
    Click Download
    Unzip the downloaded file; it will produce a folder named "ectopy"

8. In a Terminal window, install the dependencies of ectopy.js
    cd ectopy
    npm install

Running the program

1. In a Terminal window, run ectopy.js
    cd ectopy
    node ectopy.js

    (When you're done you can stop the program with Control-C)

2. Open a browser to see the application
    Open a browser to http://localhost:3000

3. Put the sensor on your finger and adjust until it's producing pulses
    I find it helps to have a pulse-ox on another finger to make sure
    the beats are correct

About the display

The graph is a Poincare phase plot of the R-R interval (what a layman calls
the heartbeat) lagged against itself with a delay of one beat.

A short beat like a PVC will appear as a dot to the left of the main cluster,
while a longer beat like an escape beat will appear as a dot to the right
of the main cluster.

It is possible to observe trigeminy and quadrigeminy patterns by following
the connections between successive beats on the graph.

Beats are color-coded based on the difference between the duration of this
beat and the previous one.

    green:  < 50ms
    orange: > 50 ms and < 100ms
    red:    > 100ms and < 200ms
    purple: > 200ms

Using Ectopy

- put the sensor on and fiddle it until the data stream looks good
- click the 'clear' button to start a new chart
- accumulate 100 beats or so
- use "mark" to add a comment to identify the chart
- take a screenshot

---
Other Facilities

The program writes every heartbeat it receives to a file named beats.log in
the ectopy directory, for future analysis.

In the More... menu, the Import and Export functions let you import and export
beat sessions in text format.
