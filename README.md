## What is it?

Ectopy is a web-based heartbeat visualizer focused on analysis of variability
in the duration of beats.

The web interface provides a real-time Poincar√© phase chart of successive beats.

The repository includes code to run on an Arduino connected to a pulse sensor,
which provides beat data to the web application.
